        <p>Whenever someone asks me where my favorite place in the world is, this image instantly comes to mind!</p>

<p>Above is a picture I took at Glacier Point in <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Yosemite+National+Park/@37.8529772,-119.831296,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8096f09df58aecc5:0x2d249c2ced8003fe!8m2!3d37.8651011!4d-119.5383294">Yosemite National Park, CA</a></strong>, located about 4 hours from San Fransisco, California.<br>
Many pair California with palm-lined beaches and "rip your hair out traffic", but few make the effort to leave the bustling cities and venture out into the wilderness.<br>
I have visited Yosemite multiple times, and no other sight compares to the white granite cliffs gleaming in the California sun!<br><br></p>

        <p>About 400 miles Southeast of Yosemite, a different landscape displays its beauty. In the American Southwest, shades of red and brown eroded sandstone create a stunning desert portrait, full of muted color and rich constrast. While Yosemite is my favorite single location, the desert is by far my favorite geographical region. I have traveled to many desert locations, but I must warn you, the summer heat is no joke.

        <p>The Pacific Northwest is known for its rain, and while it can sometimes become mundane, the copious amount of water produces some of the most spectacular waterfalls in the world!</p>

        <p>Yes, there is plenty of rain in the rainforest, but views like that above make it well worth it, even if it means dealing with wet shoes and socks all day.</p>

        <p>The Western United States has a diverse group of climates, and a multitude of National Parks to match each one! <br>
